# Teaching programming in JavaScript and p5.js

This repository contains all the teaching materials used in my programming classes at Danish high schools. These resources focus on a creative teaching approach centered around JavaScript, p5.js, p5.play, and ml5.js technologies. The teaching methodology heavily draws from the principles outlined in 'Computer Science Education,' edited by Sue Sentance, Erik Barendsen, and Carsten Schulte. Please note that the materials are in Danish.

Some materials are kindly borrowed from Daniel Shiffman, please visit him at https://thecodingtrain.com/
